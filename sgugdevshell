# TODO: figure out login shell and act accordingly.

# with bash we can set --rcfile to something. for example,
# if we wanted to "inject" stuff directly (such as a precmd
# function, for example), we could make a temporary file
# which would do all that and in the end source ~/.sgug_bashrc
# and delete itself to avoid filling up /tmp with cruft.
#
# the idea of .sgug_bashrc would be to serve as an init file for
# stuff like prompting, completion etc. the user could set up the
# shell init so that his .bashrc sets his normal PATH and friends
# and sources .sgug_bashrc in the end for the rest.
#
# just an idea - discuss!
